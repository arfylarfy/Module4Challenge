## Usage
This project has found arbitrage opportunities using CSV files on Bitstamp versus Coinbase data over time.

## Analysis Report

The analysis uses closing price data to perform a variety of calculations over several time periods with the end goal of providing visualizations of bitcoin price movement, arbitrage spread, arbitrage spread returns, and potential profit from arbitrage. The conclusions reached in the analysis provides insight into a rapid shift in arbitrage opportunity over a period of a few months. The best opportunity here was in the early months. Even by February, profits were probably not worth the effort to most people, and by March, there was little to no profit to be made through arbitrage.
